    raster_matrix: np.ndarray
        The matrix representing the raster image to be plotted.
    raster_transform
        An object of the class Affine as used by the rasterio package, which gives the transform of the raster image to

    """
    Plots the movement of tracked points as a geometry on top of a given raster image matrix. Velocity is shown via a
    colour scale, while the movement direction is shown with arrows for selected pixels.
    Parameters
    ----------
    raster_matrix: np.ndarray
        The matrix representing the raster image to be plotted.
    raster_transform :
        An object of the class Affine as used by the rasterio package, which gives the transform of the raster image to
        the coordinate reference system of the geometry GeoDataFrame.
    point_movement: gpd.GeoDataFrame
        A GeoDataFrame containing the columns "row", "column" giving the position of the points expressed in matrix
        indices, as well as "movement_column_direction", "movement_row_direction" and "movement_distance_per_year". The
        unit of the movement is taken from the coordinate reference system of this GeoDataFrame.
    point_color: str = None
        Forces all the points to have a single color specified via this string. If None, a colormap is used to denote
        different movement velocities.
    masking_polygon: gpd.GeoDataFrame = None
        A single-element GeoDataFrame to allow masking the plotted points to a certain area. If None, the points will
        not be masked.
    fig: plt.figure = None
        Specifies the figure for plotting multiple results simultaneously.
    ax: plt.ax = None
        Specifies the axes on which to plot the movement of tracked points. If None (the default) the figure is plotted
        onto a new canvas. If fig, ax are not provided, but save_path is, the figure is only saved and not displayed.
    save_path : str = None
        The file location, where the created plot is stored. When no path is given (the default), the figure is not
        saved.
    show_arrows: bool = True
        Wether to show direction arrows on the resulting image
